\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Performance}
In this paper, we design two kind of models which could apply to the tennis game. With the help the wireless sensor network, one could predict the location of the drop point of the tennis by the recieved pover and the other one could judge the tennis ball whether is out of bound or not. The accuracy of both models are relatively high. For the former one, we implement LSTM model, a RNN variant, and the loss of prediction could be less than 0.05m. For the latter one, we implement MLP model and SVM model, the accuracy is 97\% and 96\% respectively. Compared with MLP model, SVM is more lightweight but has similar accuracy, so if the sensor has very limited computing resources, SVM is a better choice.
\subsection{Future work}
The accuracy obtained in this paper are all derived from simulations. Due to the limitations of the equipment and some other reasons, we do not carry out the piratical experiments. In the future, if the condition is permitted, we may carry out experiment to verify the feasibility of the method since the accuracy of WSN depend on the real environment.
