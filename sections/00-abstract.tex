Sensors, a new class of devices, can detect, process, and communicate important data for users. Therefore, increasing Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications, such as target tracking and emergency response, have been developed in recent years. It is worth mentioning that localization algorithms could be used in many applications,such as localization.\\
There are various algorithms\cite{han2013localization} to localize the object by WSN. They mainly divided in two categories,range-based and range-free. For range-based method,there are various methods such as RSSI, TOA, TDOA and etc. The main principle of these methods is firstly obtaining  the distances between the object and at least three anchors and then compute the location.\\ 
In our paper, we introduce a machine learning based method which could localize the objective and apply it to the tennis games which could localize the drop point of tennis ball and judge the tennis ball is out of bound or not.
